# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis Project
The purpose of the School District Analysis project is to develop student and school performance analysis on reading and math scores, and to evaluate performance based on school size and budget level by high school and per student. Deliverables for the project include:
- High level snapshot of the district's key metrics
- Overview of the key metrics for each school
- Tables include
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools based on overall passing rates
  - Average math and reading scores by students in each grade level at each high school
  - School performance based on budget per student
  - School performance based on school size
  - School performance based on type of school

During development of the analysis, the district manager was informed by the school board of possible academic dishonesty from one of the high schools in the district. To uphold state-testing standards, the student scores in question were converted to null values (NaN - not a number), which required recompiling the anaylsis. As part of the project, the data deliverables were adjusted, and comparisons between the two results provided to determine how the changes affect the overall analysis.
